# Features

## Modular

Valence is built as multiple [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) plugins that all can be pulled in indivually.

## ECS

Valence uses [Bevy ECS](https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/ecs/) as its ECS. ECS is a modern approach to game design that benefits whatever.

## Performance

In contrast to the Vanilla Minecraft server Valence makes use of all CPU Cores and delivers a lot better performance.

## Lightweight

Valence is using Rust which brings very small overhead out of the box.

## Stable

Rust is a language empowering us to build reliable and efficient software. This makes Valence a very stable base for every minecraft network.
