# valence

The main Valence crate. This acts primarily as a shell to re-export the other crates and consolidate plugins. Users are expected to use the other crates indirectly through this interface.

Additionally, project examples and whole-server unit tests are stored in `examples/` and `src/tests/` respectively.
