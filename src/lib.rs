//!
//! A Rust framework for building Minecraft servers.
//!
//! At a high level, a Valence [`Server`] is a collection of [`Clients`],
//! [`Entities`], and [`Worlds`]. When a client connects to the server they are
//! added to the collection of `Clients`. After connecting, clients should
//! be assigned to a [`World`] where they can interact with the entities
//! and [`Chunks`] that are a part of it.
//!
//! The Valence documentation assumes some familiarity with Minecraft and its
//! mechanics. See the [Minecraft Wiki] for general information and [wiki.vg]
//! for protocol documentation.
//!
//! For more information, see the repository [README].

//!
//! # Logging
//!
//! Valence uses the [log] crate to report errors and other information. You may
//! want to use a logging implementation such as [env_logger] to see these
//! messages.
//!
//! [log]: https://docs.rs/log/latest/log/
//! [env_logger]: https://docs.rs/env_logger/latest/env_logger/
//!
//! # An Important Note on [`mem::swap`]
//!
//! In Valence, many types are owned by the library but given out as mutable
//! references for the user to modify. Examples of such types include [`World`],
//! [`LoadedChunk`], [`Entity`], and [`Client`].
//!
//! **You must not call [`mem::swap`] on these references (or any other
//! function that would move their location in memory).** Doing so breaks
//! invariants within the library and the resulting behavior is safe but
//! unspecified. You can think of these types as being [pinned](std::pin).
//!
//! Preventing this illegal behavior using Rust's type system was considered too
//! cumbersome, so this note has been left here instead.
//!
//! [`mem::swap`]: std::mem::swap
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! See the [examples] directory in the source repository.
